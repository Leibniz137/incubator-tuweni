# Relayer application

This application relays two hobbits endpoints.

## Usage:
```bash
$> bin/hobbits-relayer --help
Usage: <main class> [-h] [-b=<bind>] [-t=<to>]
  -b, --bind=<bind>   Endpoint to bind to
  -h, --help          Prints usage prompt
  -t, --to=<to>       Endpoint to relay to
```

The application prints out messages to STDOUT.

Sample use:

Listen to a port
```bash
$> netcat -l -p 18000
```

Set up the relayer:
```bash
$> bin/hobbits-relayer -b tcp://localhost:10000 -t tcp://localhost:18000
```

Send a message:
```bash
$> cat message 
EWP 0.2 RPC 5 5
hellohello
$> cat message | netcat localhost 10000
```

The relayer will show the message:
```bash
EWP 0.2 RPC 5 5
0x68656C6C6F
0x68656C6C6F
```

The listener will show the message, received:
```bash
$> netcat -l -p 18000
EWP 0.2 RPC 5 5
hellohello
```
